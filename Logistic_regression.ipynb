        "# Logistic regression\n",
        "is a statistical and machine learning technique used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (typically labeled as 0 and 1). Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm.\n",

        "#Regularization:\n",
        "Like linear regression, logistic regression can be regularized to prevent overfitting by adding regularization terms such as L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) to the loss function.\n",
        "\n",
        "#Evaluation:\n",
        "Common evaluation metrics for logistic regression models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve).\n",

        "# Use\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic regression is widely used in various fields, including healthcare (e.g., predicting disease outcomes), marketing (e.g., customer churn prediction), and natural language processing (e.g., sentiment analysis). In practice, it is often implemented using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn in Python, or built-in functions in statistical software like R.\n",
